              My experience with Git is limited to solo projects, so often I work locally on VS Code where I can track changes and revert as needed.
               I have worked minimally with another developer as a second pair of eyes sometimes if I am unable to identify an error but its usually via zoom. Git Install, respoitory create/delete, and maintaining origin master with most recent working files. 
              Light use of version control and source code management, through create branch, push and pull requests.

            <p>Through inspiration of my new Scientist friend, I have purchased a new domain BeakerData. This app is just in the design and naming phase and since I have the opportunity
               to work on a solution for & with a great mind I will jump on this. A Linkedin account has been created under BeakerData to gather interest as we work on the design and build.

            <h3>Just 2020</h3>
            <p>The years events have created stumbling blocks for many municipalities and organizations. We also face shifting geographical location challenges and have paused BeakerData
              at several times during 2020 as the continued geographical environment looms for some individuals.This is not canceled, simply exended time, conectivity, and funding needed 
              to produce.

              Breif update from Quarantine until now. I have worked and attained Scrum Fundamentals Certification. I have also attained a Yellow Belt in Six Sigma, HubSpot inbound 
              certification(not sure why). I have also completed some AWS Cloud Practitioner essentials digital trainings by AWS and ACloudGuru, not yet certified.

            <p>Currently working on my HubSpot Development certification (HUBL code), I am also on MS Training for finance and operations implementations. I have also started looking into
               Pods by solidproject.org if anyone has any information they would like to share on that open source project.

            <p>Going to create and set up Software4Anyone an app that I can post software training for anyone and simplified for anyone. It could be anything from basics of code, MS, other random 
               solutions I may have assisted clients with that anyone should feel free to learn at minimal cost. I do not like people to fall behind in technology use and certainly not due to lack
               of access or even due to being in the working environment for a longer time than others. New technology should not scare anyone and no one is too old to learn.

            <p>I completed my HubSpot Developer Certification unfortunatly there is some glitch in their online learning software and it it holding onto 1minunte of learning that says its outstanding
               but its not. HubSpot doesn't seem to have a help team for their education app to resolve so I can obtain my Developer Certification for HubSpot. Oh, well.</p>

            <h3>Wednesday March 17, 2021</h3>
            <p>Looks like MongoDB is my new path of learning. It is strange reflecting on years back learning a straight forward system like Microsoft SQL vs todays new DataBases in Cloud versions which 
               are filled with forms. In so many ways the older and original software code learning seem simpler than todays experience. It used to be learning lets say SQL, was logging to one environment
               and just working on SQL. Today to learn a code, you have to log into 5 different environments and know 6 different languages just to start learning said code. Good thing I can multi-task <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128522;</span>. 
               Shots out to anyone sticking with coding and further advancing your skill sets!</p>

            <h3>Sunday April 5, 2021</h3>
            <p>This past year I have assisted many individuals with resume updates and guidance. I love to help people who are in need to guidance in their career, please feel to connect with me on Linkedin
               for this. I do often share resumes of individuals with recruiters that might reach out to me as well.</p>
            <p>Currently in conjunction with learning MongoDB I am also learning to implement SmartGov software for the creators of the software.</p>
