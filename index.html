              My experience with Git is limited to solo projects, so often I work locally on VS Code where I can track changes and revert as needed.
               I have worked minimally with another developer as a second pair of eyes sometimes if I am unable to identify an error but its usually via zoom. Git Install, respoitory create/delete, and maintaining origin master with most recent working files. 
              Light use of version control and source code management, through create branch, push and pull requests.
