                Welcome to my world, it’s a crazy one. A day of life in any software industry is a wonderful joyous one similar to a mad hatter tea party where no one knows what an un-birthday party is and they still have one.  In the case of software sometimes we run a program and saying “wow is that what it was supposed to do?” in our head quietly to ourselves. 
                While at the same time saying, “Yes, I meant for that to happen.” Out loud so people believe we have everything under control. There is nothing a walk to a coffee shop cannot fix with a perfect latte with locally roasted beans!

                A life where everything right seems wrong, and everything wrong seems right. When everything works, we question why and for how long. Where people say look, I made this new code. Yet now its 5 lines of code to explain what was once 1. 
                Where documentation visualization replace socialization. Yet documentation is key to both success and failure for testing, regression testing, building, processing, and use of any product. The place where spell check does not understand my code and my code does not understand my syntax. It’s all in the perspective of life!
